    Default Controller Interface (Abstract Class).

    This abstract class defines the interface for controllers in the system.
    Subclasses must implement the following methods:
      - starting() -> None
      - updateState(pos, vel, tau, current_time) -> None
      - compute() -> None
      - getCtrlInput() -> tuple[np.ndarray, list]

    The updateState() method should use the provided robot state (positions, velocities, torques)
    to update any internal states, such as sensor readings or computed Jacobians.
